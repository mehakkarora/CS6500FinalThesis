31-01-2022 23:52,Absolutely the best!! But if you cancel Joe Rogan.. I know at least 45 people will cancel their service including myself..,5,1,
31-01-2022 23:49,"This app is great, but one thing I hate WITH A PASSIONðŸ¤¬ is that you can't view the playlists you made separately from playlists you follow or download. I can't express how stupid that is, like it should be one of the first things you'd be able to do, separate your playlists with followed playlists. Come on. It eats me up. I don't know why it bothers me so much, but it does. 4 stars. Everything else is amazing.",4,42,

31-01-2022 23:29,"Spotify was working just fine. However & without any reason, the app started to ""grow"", in terms of storage space. Without my doing anything, the app grew to 11 gigabit within just a few days. I wasn't downloading, I wasn't doing anything. I got warnings from my smartphone about running out of memory space, it was adversely affecting my smartphones battery condition. So, I've had to with great reluctance, uninstall.",2,0,
31-01-2022 23:22,"App is missing a lot of very obvious features. Needs a ""shuffle album"" and ""shuffle artist"" button like every other media player since time began. Needs to be able to scroll back in the Queue to see what's already played.",3,2,
31-01-2022 23:19,"Perhaps the most questionable UI/UX decisions I've ever seen. Why would you remove the 'My Songs' search bar at the top? Why make scrubbing through tracks less sensitive to touch? Less bells and whistles, more focus on functionality. Tell your product designers to step it up.",2,3,
31-01-2022 23:06,"Kinda convenient, but they keep sacking artists and it is slow and buggy during offline use.",2,0,

31-01-2022 22:52,Why does spotify keep crashing only phone? Every 30 minutes or so it crashes. I have to kick my phone reopen spotify everytime.,1,0,
31-01-2022 22:41,A great app. It's free and I'm satisfied for what it offers without paying a dime. Great platform and no discrepancies whatsoever. Highly recommend it to everyone.,4,4,

31-01-2022 22:25,So almost every jre podcast I listen to gets reset back to the begining after listening between 50 min and 1h20 min of content and goes to the next podcast leaving me to try and guess where I left off. Issue #2 I mainly listen to stuff while I'm at work and my work barely gets any cell reception so I have to download all my content. In order to access my downloaded content I have to shut my data off and then all my downloaded stuff will pop up after about 30 sec then I can turn my data back on.,2,1,

31-01-2022 21:45,When first opened up Spotify it was a 5 star thing until today I found out that I can't put on my favorite songs but had to shuffle them all until I get my favorite song not only that on my Tablet it had the things that said that it didn't had to do the shuffle but just press on the full song instead of pressing on it for a sample of the song the things before the worst thing happened on my phone.,2,5,
31-01-2022 21:45,"If you're terrified of a bald man, who likes to sit down and just have a conversation, this app is not for you. As long as Spotify stands for free speech, I will stand with Spotify.",5,1,

Also, a minor problem, when I got my spotify wrapped, it said my favorite genre of music was 'Classic Rock...' I listen to Nirvana, Sabbath, Floyd, and those 80s/90s bands.

My biggest issue is it randomly starts playing a sleep play list any time between 1am and 3am. It does this if I'm sound asleep or listening to other songs. Also incredibly annoying is that it says enjoy the next 30 minutes as free... plays one song and an ad comes on. I don't understand why we can't listen to an album in order or a specific song. We pay by listening to the ads!,2,28,

You type the name of a song in the search bar and click play on the song and a random song from another artist will start playing. You add the song you wanted to hear on an empty playlist and click play and a random song from another artist will start playing. Its literally impossible to listen to what you want. Your app literally only has one job. Incredible levels of incompetence,1,12,

12-01-2022 21:43,I like all the variety of music you have on here however when I make a playlist and I usually have about 40 or 50 songs on there it keeps playing the same 5 or 10 songs over and over again without playing the other songs that are on my playlist that really sucks it's no different than listening to the radio the idea was so I wouldn't have to listen to the same songs over and over again but this app plays the same music over and over again without playing every song in your playlist pointless,2,4,

11-01-2022 10:33,Spotify is the best streaming service there is. You can download playlists play songs over and over again or choose them all for free. My favourite part is the fact that you can create your own music. I like how you can follow artists so that you get notified when they drop a song. Spotify is smart enough to suggest songs you would like based of your listening and what artists you follow. At the end of the year Spotify reviews your listening with wrapped. This is a fun look back at your year.,5,52,

Every important song from older albums is missing Edit: it's still bad: there is a section in the app specifically designed for the songs you ""like"" from chosen artists. That ""playlist"" adds extra songs in it. Example: if I go on an artist like 2Pac, there are songs from him that I enjoy so I click on like. However, there are other songs, that don't even have the ""liked"" song icon on it but are in the playlist. What's the point? Shame!",1,16,

01-01-2022 23:16,"3 hours into your 5 hours podcast?

But the app doesn't let me in when I'm offline and instead takes me to the login page. Having inconsistent internet connection during the trip meant I could no longer login and access the downloaded songs. Also, when I managed to log back in later using a slow internet connection, the app tried to download all the downloaded songs again which was not possible with the limited slow internet that I had during the trip. App is not designed to be your travel companion and can be enjoyed only in home where you have proper internet connection. For travel and trips where you need offline access to your favourties playlists, Spotify premium doesn't help. Looking at other options.",3,2,
