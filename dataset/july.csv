09-07-2022 13:11,"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",1,318,

Depending on where I am when I select an episode, a new one may or may not autoplay at the end. I want autoplay for music but not for podcasts... please and thank you!
