30-04-2022 23:56,I love Spotify becuse it shows all the songs im looking for.there recomendacions are the best.i hate when there is ads but apart from that Spotify is the best music app,5,2,
30-04-2022 23:49,"Gives you the ability to listen to a plethora of music artists and genres. For a monthly subscription you can disable the advertisements. Good value for money, I'd reccomend this app.",5,0,
30-04-2022 23:47,I loved the app however for the past months it won't play my offline songs offline and the music keeps pausing mid playlist or even after one or two songs. It seems that many people are having this same issue so I hope they can fix it soon.,3,0,

30-04-2022 23:36,"While on vacation, Spotify is great for providing music. Works without shutting down during operation as some platforms do. I enjoy listening to music when going to sleep, there are many Playlist to choose from.",5,0,
30-04-2022 23:29,"Great app but atm it's acting up. I can't sample songs before I add them into my playlists anymore so I don't know what I'm adding. I've close the app, uninstalled it and nothing works. It's a real bummer and defeats the purpose of this being a music app if I can't even choose what I listen to.",2,2,

30-04-2022 23:20,Absolutely love how well it works as a member and my kids can have their own playlists. It's always with me! Thanks Spotify!,5,0,

30-04-2022 22:55,"WOW, THESE REVIEWS!!! SPOTIFY ARE NOT LISTENING!!! Glitchier and glitchier.. Has always been a sterling app but something has changed. These days it randomly stops and most frustratingly, will be playing, but the play button has the 'triangle' and not the pause button, so you can't stop what is playing! The only way to get it to stop is turn the phone off. Very poor.",2,15,

30-04-2022 22:52,"I have a lot of songs liked in Spotify. Unfortunately, at times the app will start playing songs I've never heard of and have not liked. When I go into Spotify and tap on my library and select my liked songs, I expect the app to play only my liked songs. If the app does not stop playing songs that I have not liked, then I will uninstall the app and find another. Also, Spotify keeps stopping and I don't like that.",1,0,
30-04-2022 22:50,"I've been using Spotify for my music since like 2011 and have been a premium user for probably the last seven years, absolutely love it. My one problem consistently is that I cannot reorganize the songs in my ""liked"" playlist which is my main playlist. I just wanna be able to put the songs in order in the way I like them. Otherwise it's great.",4,13,

30-04-2022 22:46,TRASH! Only reason to have spotify is the Joe Rogan experience. Spotify goes out of thier way to interrupt your listening with thier pop up ads for thier paid service. The app barely streams with full 5g and isn't much better on wifi 15 ft from the router.,1,0,
30-04-2022 22:43,I love Spotify obviously but why did it revert an update. Now I can't do basic things like swipe right to add to queue,5,0,
30-04-2022 22:41,"This is one of the paid subscriptions that is worth it!! Love accessing exactly what I want, different family members having our own specific content, the various podcasts are awesome and obviously no ads! Works with our Google which is perfect.",5,0,
30-04-2022 22:37,Only plays the preview of a song if you're on the free version. Pretty stupid considering you can play the whole song on a free plan on desktop.,1,0,

30-04-2022 22:23,"Hey, I love this app, but for some reason you can't listen to reccomended songs anymore on the ""add songs"" list. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it just doesn't seem to work anymore. Anyone else having this problem? This is the main way I discover new songs.",3,0,
30-04-2022 22:21,I am installing only vbecause of too many adds. It's utterly spoiling the mood. Then no use of listening to music. FM RADIO is better than this.,1,0,

30-04-2022 21:52,"4/30/2022: still force closes on Android. Been happening a lot lately. Not what I pay for in a premium sub. Have to fix this. 6/6/2021 update: went from 4 * to 3 bc its stops suddenly and restarts. a suggestion - you should be able to shuffle all playlist instead of one playlist at a time. Sometimes, one wants more of a variety. If you look at Pandora you can shuffle all your playlist to keep things from getting boring. It's an idea that I believe most would agree to. Good service though.",3,42,
30-04-2022 21:46,Latest update absolutely sucks. I just recently downloaded it again after a months and I'm very disappointed. They've removed the feature where u can play a short snippet of the song before adding to a Playlist and that just irritates me rn,2,1,
30-04-2022 21:46,I deleted it because it was being really weird after I was using it for a while and then it like stopped and it wouldn't show like my playlist then after that I tried to redownload it and it wouldn't let me login. Because I don't know why so I'm giving it a one star you're welcome Spotify.,1,0,
30-04-2022 21:41,App constantly stops playing audio and doesn't allow me to change items or play/pause when I want,2,0,
30-04-2022 21:39,I app is glitchy. It seams lazily made though maybe it's much harder then I think to make an app like this. Often the bar at the bottom of the screen that is used to pause or skip a playing song isn't there (this is a new issue) and I have to restart my phone or delete the app to stop it playing. If I am playing a play list on random and switch devices it seams to restart the random and very quickly play the same songs I just heard. The recommendation algorithms are way off.,3,5,

Can't pick what songs you actually want to play will only play from playlists, only 6 skips per hour when you can't even pick a direct song only shuffle play??

30-04-2022 21:11,Searching ome song then play it but different different sings starts playing. Very irritating,1,0,
30-04-2022 21:11,Great app but don't be fooled. When it says you can download songs after getting the premium version it's not true. Songs only get downloaded on the app no app no songs and there's no choice to download onto your device,3,0,
30-04-2022 21:08,"I pay for premium don't give me pop-up ads. The new car mode doesn't let you control the music from the car at all, which is incredibly unsafe and asinine. The new lyrics feature is garbage and makes the player lag. I am this close to just trashing Spotify and swapping to another music service. Update: Not even the basic functionality of prev/next song works consistently any more. That's it. I'm done.",1,7,

30-04-2022 20:58,"Personally, I think it's the best app to listen to music to. But it includes too many advertisements and adds unwanted songs.For example, I removed a song off my playlist and it was automatically re-added.",4,0,
30-04-2022 20:43,"Spotify is a great comfort zone of music. There's all kinds of audios, not only music. There's religious recitations such as Qur'an, there's rain sounds, relaxing music and different types of ASMR. I personally recommend Spotify. Plus, the ""No ads"" feature isn't very expensive. It's close to a dollar.",5,1,
30-04-2022 20:38,"Best collection of music, features & plans that you can share with your friend or family. Interface is very easy to use. Great for parties as you can customise your own playlists to themes you like. 10/10 for me",5,0,

30-04-2022 19:39,Stops loading songs unless the screen is on. Which is resolved with a forced close. Starts playing song randomly in my pocket. Only resolved with a forced close. Stops responding to controls on Bluetooth. Across all Bluetooth devices. Only resolved with a forced close. I would say on average I have to force close the app 4-5 times a day.

30-04-2022 19:14,"The ads on the app are massively louder than the music. A terrible way to bully people into upgrading. That itself makes it borderline unusable for me. Sometimes, the app loads without the bar for play/pause buttons, and it's impossible to control anything. It often keeps playing random songs after a playlist is done, instead of stopping. I switched to a competitor, and don't have all these problems anymore.",1,0,
30-04-2022 19:09,"The app is quite good, but I don't know why the songs are downloaded everytime I open the app, though I have premium. It must be downloaded one time only, so that I can listen them anytime. That's why I have listen them online, despite having premium account.",4,0,

Eventually I subscribed to the student premium using my stipend money. I haven't regretted it since.",5,553,

02-04-2022 14:19,"I very rarely leave reviews and if I do, they're almost never negative but I feel compelled in this instance, as the Spotify app has got to be the worst app I have ever used. I'm on pay as you go with no Internet access unless I'm on Wi-Fi and all I use this app for is to listen to podcasts which I download in full before my work commute. It's obvious it simply has not been designed with any consideration for a user like myself. I would go as far as to state that it's terrible for podcasts in general, regardless of how you use your phone. To give you some examples: 1. When I'm at work, my phone will connect to the work Wi-Fi. There's an internal authorisation process to let devices use Internet when on the company network. What happens is that I can't play any podcasts if my phone's Wi-Fi is on - I press the play button, but nothing happens. I have two phones, one authorised to use the network and one not and this happens on both of them. I think what is taking place in the first instance is that our heavily filtered network will not let Spotify download ads and it completely throws it out of the loop. In the second instance, I think even though my phone is well aware it has no Internet access (despite being connected to Wi-Fi), Spotify ignores this fact and still tries to download ads before playing my podcasts. So every time I'm still within the huge range of my company's Wi-Fi, I need to disable my phone's Wi-Fi before I can play my podcasts for the commute home. After they start playing, I'm free to switch the Wi-Fi back on. But this isn't even the worst that this app does. 2. Quite frequently, right when I leave my company's Wi-Fi range (it always happens at almost the exact spot down to a few meters), the podcast that is being currently played will stop, losing its progress and the next one on the list will start playing. This is especially aggravating when I'm in the car and switching back to the podcast I was listening to and then finding the exact spot where I finished is impossible to do safely without stopping somewhere. But this still isn't the worst of it. 3. Recently the app started to randomly show all of my podcasts as not downloaded or actually deleting them (I'm still not sure what exactly happens as this only occurred 3 times so far, but all instances within the last month). The first time it happened, I've noticed as I walked out the door for work that my podcasts were gone. I had to redownload them all before leaving - I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where my bosses don't care what time I clock in but otherwise I'd probably by quite irritated. The next couple times it happened as I was trying to play my podcasts on my way home from work - but in those cases, when I got home, they annoyingly again started showing as downloaded and I could play them with no problems. Mind you, I have 40GB of free storage on my phone. And then there's the absolutely shockingly unusable and ugly interface (but I suppose it does fit the terrible Spotify logo). Manually removing a downloaded podcast from my playlist and downloads is an unintuitive multi-step process. I can't even change the order my podcasts will play in once they're on my playlist. I couldn't find a way to loop the playlist either, so if the last episode on your playlist is the first one you'll want to play, then you'll have to manually start the list from the top once it finishes. It can be supper annoying if this happens when you're on a motorway. It's like whoever created this app hasn't actually used it. It just blows my mind that a company as big as Spotify can't make an app that works, is usable and doesn't look like it was designed in Excel (actually, you can do much prettier things in Excel than that).",1,580,

Also even in offline mode anything downloaded still loads for 30 seconds to 1 minute before letting me see whats in the album or playlist. I don't understand why its doing this. The content is already on my phone just open the album. Same thing happens when opening download with wifi. Why?",3,58,

Constantly switching my music off whilst I'm listening to it (even downloaded songs, so it has nothing to do with Wi-Fi. It randomly plays on other devises (around a workplace) without asking me first or even letting me know?! Worst music app ever. I want my money back.",1,43,
01-04-2022 06:37,Really unhappy lately. I have a premium account. And it takes so much time to load even the home page. I have good connection and even in WiFi it takes long to load or even search a song. Please fix it.,3,0,

01-04-2022 05:40,"Very poor experience with the free version. I can't even search and play a song . They are allowing only 6 skips in an hour. And if we search for a song the app is giving a play list ( Not the exact song). We can't even see what all songs included in that list. We should skip too many songs to find the song which we are looking for . As i told before, they are allowing only 6 skips in an hour, its not possible to find the song we need to play. Nice strategy dear SPORTIFY. Anyway UNINSTALLING!!!",1,2721,

01-04-2022 04:36,Probably the best music app but there are some things like the song and album duplication which is the most annoying thing and I think it's had a pretty easy solution. Also some other things I don't remember but overall it's pretty oküëç,4,21,

01-04-2022 03:49,Best music streaming service. The only advantage Apple has over Spotify is the availability of censored versions of a lot of the musical content which is important for me. Otherwise Spotify rocks.,5,2,
